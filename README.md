# Color correction
Here I`m try to do my first project with OpenCV and Python.
It must take a colorchacker image, distort every color and than back pure color through my future algoritms.
Main directory is contained two colorchecker image.

Latest program vertion:

1)"function.py" - consists most of important functions

2)"CCD correction example.py" - restruction CCD color checker to normal colors

3)"Distortion_and_restruction_big_CC.py" - get CC, distortion it and restruction. Result have 3 squared on color: start_color, dist_color, res_color.
